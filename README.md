# WGS nf-core raredisease test

This project aims on testing the nf-core raredisease pipeline for usage with whole-genome sequencing short-read Illumina data.

## Data

For testing we use the GIAB Ashkenazim trio patient samples:

Son: HG002
Father: HG003
Mother: HG004

These were sequenced using Illumina WGS 2x 250bp technology, more information about library prepration and sequencing can be found in the [README](data/README_NIST_Illumina_pairedend_2x250_HG002.txt).

Data was downloaded from NCBI FTP server and indexes extracted from https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle/giab_data_indexes on 8th August 2023.
